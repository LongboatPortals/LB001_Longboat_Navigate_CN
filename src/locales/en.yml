prw.faq1: "What are clinical research studies?"
prw.faq1_a: "Clinical research studies are scientific investigations that are conducted to find out if a new treatment is safe and effective for people. These studies are conducted to determine whether new drugs or treatments are better than those that are currently available. Clinical research studies are also conducted to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases."

prw.faq2: "Who is involved in clinical research studies?"
prw.faq2_a: "Clinical research studies involve a team of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers. The team works together to ensure that the study is conducted safely and ethically. Patients who participate in clinical research studies are also an important part of the team. They help to determine whether the new treatment is safe and effective."

prw.faq3: "For how long will I take part in this study?"
prw.faq3_a: "If you qualify and are selected for Navigate, your involvement will last up to 18 months. During this time, you will be expected to take the study drug as directed by the study doctor and assist the study doctor and their team by participating in study assessments."

prw.faq4: "What happens if I leave the study?"
prw.faq4_a: "If you decide to leave the study before it is completed, you should inform your study doctor as soon as possible. Your study doctor will discuss the reasons for leaving the study with you and provide you with any necessary follow-up care. Leaving the study early will not affect the quality of care you receive from your study doctor."

prw.faq5: "What about side effects?"
prw.faq5_a: "All medications, including those used in clinical research studies, can cause side effects. The study doctor will discuss the potential side effects of the study drug with you before you decide to participate in the study. If you experience any side effects during the study, you should inform your study doctor as soon as possible. Your study doctor will provide you with any necessary follow-up care."

prw.faq6: "What are the benefits of participating in a clinical research study?"
prw.faq6_a: "Participating in a clinical research study can provide you with access to new treatments that are not yet available to the general public. These treatments may be more effective than those that are currently available. By participating in a clinical research study, you can also help to advance medical knowledge and improve the care of patients in the future."

prw.faq7: "What are the risks of participating in a clinical research study?"
prw.faq7_a: "Participating in a clinical research study involves some risks. The study doctor will discuss the potential risks of the study with you before you decide to participate. These risks may include side effects from the study drug, discomfort from study procedures, and the inconvenience of study visits. If you experience any side effects or other problems during the study, you should inform your study doctor as soon as possible."
